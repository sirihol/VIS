          <p>When doing an visualization it is really important to do a thorough analysis of existing visualizations to get a feeling of what is working and what is not. We have found three other visualization that we have taken a lot of inspiration from, and which we will present here. </p>

          <h2 id="A World of Terror"> A World of Terror</h2>
           <p><a href="http://terror.periscopic.com/">A World of Terror</a> is a graphical look at the 25 most impactful terrorist organizations since 1970. This visualization was made by <a href="http://www.periscopic.com/">Periscopic</a>, and is using the same data that we are using from GTD.</p>

            <img alt="wot" class="img-responsive" src="wot.jpg"></a>
          

          <p class="text-center"><i>Figure 1: A World of Terror, a vizualization by Periscopic.</i></p> 


          <h3 id="">Space, grouping and shape </h3>
          <p>The visualization presents a lot of information at once, by showing all the data at one page. They have made this possible by grouping the different groups on the right hand side, while having a panel with further information on the left hand side. They also the possibility of grouping the different terror groups by various attributes, for instance by “longest active group”. By doing so they have made it possible for the user to get an overview while having the opportunity to zoom and filter. What we found hard in this grouping, was to compare groups that have approximately the same “impact”. The use of a mini map to show where in the world the different attacks have been is also a good feature.</p> 

          <p>Each terrorist group consists of a rectangle where both dimensions represent time. The width is a timeline from 1970 to 2013, and the height stretches from December to January. Weirdly enough it is not the other from January to December. The number of incident is represented by a gray square in the given month of the specific given year. The intensity of the square indicates the number of incidents in that given month.Above and below the incident rectangle they have placed colored bar charts indicating the total number of victims in a given year - killed above and wounded below. We found this hard to compare and have tried to improve in our design. </p>
          
          <h3 id="">Color</h3>
          
          <p>The visualization uses a brown color theme, with red and yellow as contrast colors to highlight some information and make it pop slightly out. By using red and yellow whom are both close to brown (they are each side of brown on the color scale), this contrast gets well balanced and the page as a whole is visually appealing to look at. Red is used to represent the number of killed while yellow is used to represent the number of wounded, this makes sense in both cases, as red is often a symbol of danger while yellow can be a symbol of near danger.</p>

           <h2 id="Global Terrorism Visualization"> Global Terrorism Visualization</h2>
           <p>For inspiration for our overview of the data we looked at a visualization that is called <a href="http://cse512-14w.github.io/a3-chaoyu-aniket/">Global Terrorism Visualization</a> and was made by Chaoyu Yang and Aniket Handa who have developed a application for exploring the trends and events that shaped the history due to Terrorism. Their visualization consists of a map view together with a bar chart graph of the total number of killed per year as well as a more detailed view of countries.</p>

           <a href="gtv.jpg" class="fullsizable" alt="Responsive image">
            <img alt="gtv" class="img-responsive" src="gtv.jpg"></a>
          

          <p class="text-center"><i>Figure 2: Global Terrorism Visualization, a vizualization by Chaoyu Yang and Aniket Handa.</i></p> 

          <h3 id="">Color</h3>
          Different saturations of red where the intensity represent higher quantity works good to represent the number of killed. It can be difficult to compare two countries that have the same color, but in this case there is the possibility of hovering over specific countries for more precise information. The color of the bar chart that represents the number of killed works really well. When the number is high the color of the bar is darker as well as the size is bigger, this makes it easy to answer visual queries like “have the number of killed in terror incidents increased the last 20 years?”.<p/>

          <h3 id="">Exploration</h3>
          <p>The ability to explore the data is done well in this visualization. You both have the opportunity to focus the timeline as well as choosing different countries to explore further or compare to others. We have used this in our design, but with regions instead of countries. </p>
